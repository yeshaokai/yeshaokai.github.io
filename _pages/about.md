I am a second year PhD student in Mathis Lab at EPFL, under the supervision of professor Mackenzie Mathis. My research interest is to bridge neurosience and AI. In the AI side, I am building more generalizable animal pose estimator that allows across species, across datasets inference. While such a task acts as a good playground to study deep nets' generalization and adaptivitiy, it also helps to provide better tools for neuroscientists to study animals' behavior. At the same time, I also work on using realistic musculoskeletal model and neural networks to reverse engineer the brain of laboratory mice. 

News:

* [Mar 2022] our paper about multi animal pose estimation and tracking was accepted by [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01443-0)

* [Mar 2022] our paper about building more robust vision transformer was accpted by CVPR 2022.

* [Mar 2021] 2 papers about adversarial vulnerability of neural networks were accpeted by CVPR 2021.

* [Dec 2021] I passed my candidacy exam. 

* [Dec 2020] I moved to Geneva and joined Mathis Lab as a PhD student.
